- Error Handling: Alerts the user if the city name is missing or if data cannot be fetched.

 Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+): Async/await for API requests, error handling, and DOM manipulation.
- HTML/CSS: Basic layout and styling for user input and weather card display.

 Example Code

javascript
async function getWeatherData(city) {
    let apiUrl = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apiKey}`;
    let response = await fetch(apiUrl);
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error("Data not found");
    }
    return response.json();
}


 API

This app uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch current weather data.

 Note

To use this app, you need to sign up on OpenWeather to get your own API key and replace the placeholder API key in the JavaScript code.
